LionGateOS – Phase 3 Cleanup (Delete Legacy Folders)
===================================================

This helper script removes old ConstructOS / StudioAI legacy folders
that are no longer used by LionGateOS:

  - legacy-shell
  - os-shell-legacy
  - preview

How to use:

1. Ensure this file and delete_legacy_folders.bat are located in your
   main LionGateOS folder, for example:

      I:\LionGateOS\delete_legacy_folders.bat
      I:\LionGateOS\README_Phase3_Cleanup.txt

2. Double-click:

      delete_legacy_folders.bat

3. A command window will open, explain what it will do, and ask you to
   press a key before continuing.

4. The script will delete ONLY the three folders listed above, and only
   if they exist.

5. When it says "Cleanup complete", you can close the window.

You do not need to edit any code. This operation is limited strictly
to removing obsolete legacy-shell / ConstructOS-era folders.
