LionGateOS Gateway (Netlify Drop)

Deploy instructions (simple):
1) Open https://app.netlify.com/drop in your browser.
2) Drag-and-drop this folder's CONTENTS (index.html and assets folder) into the drop area.
3) Confirm the deployed page looks correct, then connect or deploy it to your liongateos.com Netlify site using your usual process.

If you prefer deploying directly to your existing site: open your site in Netlify, go to the deploy page where Netlify shows a drag-and-drop area, and drop this folder's contents there.
