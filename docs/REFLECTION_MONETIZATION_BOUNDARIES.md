# Reflection Monetization Boundaries (Planner v1)

## Guiding Principle
LionGateOS monetizes **clarity**, never **pressure**.

---

## What Is Free

- Viewing reflected events
- Basic timelines
- Category grouping
- Source traceability
- Reality view

---

## What May Be Paid

- Historical depth
- Advanced comparison views
- Scenario overlays
- Export formats
- Multi-project aggregation

---

## What Is Never Monetized

- Recommendations
- Optimization
- Forecasting
- Behavioral scoring
- Locked decisions

---

## Cross-App Consistency

These rules apply equally to:
- Budget
- Travels (when reflected)
- SmartQuote AI (when reflected)

---

## Trust Rule
If monetization could be interpreted as “pushing a decision,” it is disallowed.

---

## Status
Planner v1 — Locked
