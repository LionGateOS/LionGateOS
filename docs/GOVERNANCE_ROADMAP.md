## 1. Authority and Purpose (LOCKED)

This document defines the **forward-looking governance roadmap** for LionGateOS.
It outlines planned governance milestones aligned to the Governance Maturity Model, without introducing implementation commitments or timelines.

This roadmap is descriptive and directional. It introduces **no runtime behavior**.

---

## 2. Roadmap Principles (LOCKED)

1. **Governance Before Implementation:** Governance clarity precedes technical change.
2. **Additive Evolution:** New governance capabilities build on existing artifacts.
3. **Evidence-Driven Progress:** Advancement is demonstrated by new or extended governance artifacts.
4. **Non-Binding:** The roadmap does not obligate delivery dates or features.
5. **Transparency:** Planned directions are visible and auditable.

---

## 3. Current Baseline (LOCKED)

LionGateOS currently maintains:
- Canonical security event taxonomy
- Deterministic threat classification
- Formal incident lifecycle and post-incident review
- Cross-boundary trust governance
- Controlled security overrides
- Additive-only governance change control
- Comprehensive governance index and glossary

This baseline aligns with **Governance Maturity Level 1–2**.

---

## 4. Near-Term Governance Directions (FOUNDATIONAL → CONTROLLED)

Planned focus areas:
- Expansion of event taxonomy for new app domains
- Refinement of threat classification rationale codes
- Standardization of governance review cadence
- Formalization of governance KPIs (definition only)

Expected artifacts:
- Additive updates to SECURITY_EVENTS_SCHEMA.md
- Addenda to THREAT_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL.md
- Governance review addendum

---

## 5. Mid-Term Governance Directions (CONTROLLED → OPERATIONALIZED)

Planned focus areas:
- Stronger linkage between PIR outcomes and governance updates
- Cross-app governance consistency checks
- Trust boundary refinement for AI-driven actions

Expected artifacts:
- Governance feedback loop addendum
- Cross-app governance consistency contract
- AI governance extensions (non-runtime)

---

## 6. Long-Term Governance Directions (MEASURED → ADAPTIVE)

Planned focus areas:
- Scenario-based governance planning
- Proactive risk modeling at governance level
- Governance resilience under rapid scale

Expected artifacts:
- Scenario planning governance pack
- Governance stress-testing framework
- Adaptive governance addenda

---

## 7. Non-Goals (LOCKED)

This roadmap does NOT:
- Commit to implementation timelines
- Replace technical roadmaps
- Mandate specific tools or metrics
- Guarantee maturity progression
