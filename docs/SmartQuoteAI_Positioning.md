# SmartQuoteAI — Canonical Positioning

## What is SmartQuoteAI?
SmartQuoteAI is a trust-first estimating tool.

It helps you explain your price in plain language so clients understand what they’re paying for, why the price exists, and what could cause it to change.

SmartQuoteAI is not a calculator, not a price list, and not an automated quote generator.
It is a clarity tool designed to reduce confusion, disputes, and underbidding.

## Who is it for?
SmartQuoteAI is built for:
- Independent contractors
- Small business owners
- First-time or informal estimators
- DIY users who understand the work but struggle to explain pricing clearly

It is intentionally human-scale and practical.

## Why SmartQuoteAI exists
Most pricing problems don’t come from bad math.
They come from unclear scope, unstated assumptions, and misaligned expectations.

SmartQuoteAI makes those invisible risks visible before an estimate is accepted.

## Why users trust it
SmartQuoteAI is deterministic and explainable.

It does not guess prices.
It does not hide assumptions.
It does not promise certainty where none exists.

Instead, it clearly shows:
- What is included
- What is optional or variable
- What is not included
- What causes prices to change
- Who is responsible for what

Clarity is the product. Trust is the outcome.
