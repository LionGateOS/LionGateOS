## 1. Purpose (LOCKED)

This document provides a concise, non-technical **security assurance statement** describing how LionGateOS approaches security, governance, and risk management.

It is intended for external audiences and summarizes posture without exposing sensitive details.
This statement does not introduce requirements, guarantees, or runtime behavior.

---

## 2. Security Philosophy (LOCKED)

LionGateOS is designed with a governance-first security model.
Security controls, incident handling, and change management are defined through immutable, additive-only governance artifacts that prioritize transparency, traceability, and least privilege.

Security decisions are documented, reviewable, and auditable by design.

---

## 3. Governance & Controls Overview (LOCKED)

LionGateOS maintains a comprehensive set of governance contracts covering:

- Security event definition and audit telemetry
- Deterministic threat classification
- Formal incident lifecycle management
- Controlled security policy overrides
- Cross-application trust boundaries
- Post-incident review and continuous improvement
- Additive-only governance change control

These contracts are non-visual, non-runtime, and enforced as authoritative rules.

---

## 4. Risk Management Approach (LOCKED)

Risk within LionGateOS is managed through:

- Standardized security event emission and correlation
- Impact-based threat classification independent of signal confidence
- Conservative escalation under ambiguity
- Explicit incident creation and lifecycle tracking
- Mandatory review following material incidents or exceptions

Risk decisions are recorded and retained for audit and learning purposes.

---

## 5. Access & Trust (LOCKED)

Access and trust within LionGateOS are governed by:

- Explicit permission evaluation
- Least-privilege defaults
- Controlled, time-bound exceptions with full auditability
- Reduced trust posture during active incidents
- Clear boundaries between applications, tenants, and integrations

No implicit trust is granted across boundaries.

---

## 6. Continuous Improvement (LOCKED)

LionGateOS incorporates structured learning through:

- Mandatory post-incident reviews for qualifying incidents
- Corrective and preventive action tracking
- Governance feedback loops that inform future policy evolution
- A staged governance maturity model guiding improvement over time

---

## 7. Transparency & Assurance Limits (LOCKED)

This statement:

- Does not assert certification or regulatory compliance
- Does not replace formal audits or assessments
- Does not disclose sensitive implementation details
- Reflects governance posture at a point in time

Detailed evidence may be provided under appropriate agreements.
