# AI Enablement Summary (Operator View)

This document is a **non-authoritative operator-facing summary** of SmartQuoteAI AI enablement.

Authoritative governance lives in:
Project Lifesaver → SMARTQUOTEAI_GOVERNANCE → PHASE_5

## Purpose
Provide a simple explanation of:
- Why AI is enabled from day one
- How costs are controlled
- What happens when limits are reached

## Key Rules (Plain English)
- AI is ON by default but limited.
- Each user has a small free monthly quota.
- Paid plans increase usage.
- If limits are reached, the UI degrades gracefully (no dead ends).
- A global kill switch exists for safety.

## Billing Model
- Default: Platform pays (shared Gemini key).
- Optional future mode: User-supplied API keys.

## What This Document Is Not
- This is NOT a policy authority.
- This does NOT override governance.
- This does NOT define quotas.

See Project Lifesaver for full governance.
