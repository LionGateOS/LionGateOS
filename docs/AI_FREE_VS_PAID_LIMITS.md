# AI FREE VS PAID USAGE POLICY
**Authority:** LionGateOS  
**Scope:** All AI-enabled modules (including SmartQuoteAI)  
**Phase:** 6 — Controlled AI Enablement  
**Status:** DRAFT (Design-only, no execution)

---

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines how AI functionality is:

- Available from day one
- Cost-controlled for the operator
- Fairly limited for free users
- Expanded for paid users
- Protected against runaway spend

This policy ensures AI grows **with** user adoption, not ahead of it.

---

## 2. CORE PRINCIPLES (LOCKED)

- AI is **visible**, never hidden
- AI is **user-triggered only**
- AI is **metered, not unlimited**
- AI is **non-authoritative**
- AI usage is **auditable**
- AI can be **disabled instantly**

---

## 3. FREE TIER AI ACCESS

Free users are granted limited AI access to:

- Experience value
- Learn capabilities
- Avoid dead-end UX

### Free Tier Limits

| Dimension | Limit |
|--------|------|
| AI actions | 2 per calendar month |
| Max tokens per action | Low (short-form responses) |
| Response depth | Summary / explanation only |
| Pricing authority | ❌ Not allowed |
| Automation | ❌ Not allowed |

### Free Tier Characteristics

- Usage resets monthly
- No background or automatic AI calls
- AI output is informational only
- UI must display remaining usage

---

## 4. PAID TIER AI ACCESS

Paid users unlock expanded AI capabilities.

### Paid Tier Capabilities

| Dimension | Access |
|-------|-------|
| AI actions | Increased or unlimited (plan-based) |
| Token limits | Higher |
| Response depth | Full explanations |
| Pricing authority | ❌ Still not allowed |
| Automation | ❌ Still not allowed |

> Pricing decisions remain human-authorized until explicitly unlocked in a future phase.

---

## 5. COST CONTAINMENT (GLOBAL)

To protect the operator:

- Hard monthly spend ceiling is enforced
- AI shuts off automatically when ceiling is reached
- No overages are permitted
- Ceiling is configurable without redeploy

Example:
- Monthly AI budget: $25
- When reached → AI disabled platform-wide until reset

---

## 6. UX REQUIREMENTS

AI UI must:

- Clearly label Free vs Paid limits
- Show remaining usage
- Never present “AI unavailable” dead ends
- Offer upgrade paths calmly (non-blocking)

---

## 7. FUTURE EXTENSION (NOT ACTIVE)

Explicitly NOT enabled in this phase:

- Autonomous AI
- Background AI
- AI-to-AI calls
- Execution authority
- Silent inference

These require separate governance approval.

---

## 8. AUTHORITY & CHANGE CONTROL

- This file is authoritative for AI tier behavior
- Changes require Phase 6 revision
- No code implementation permitted under this document
