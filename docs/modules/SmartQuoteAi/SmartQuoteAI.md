====================
SMARTQUOTEAI — CANONICAL MODULE DEFINITION (LIONGATEOS)
====================

Module Type:
Trust & clarity layer for pricing and estimating

Primary Function:
SmartQuoteAI reduces pricing disputes and expectation misalignment by making scope, assumptions, and risk explicit in plain language.

What SmartQuoteAI IS:
- A deterministic estimating companion
- A scope-clarity and responsibility-alignment tool
- A dispute-reduction and confidence-building system

What SmartQuoteAI is NOT:
- Not an automated pricing engine
- Not a calculator replacement
- Not an AI demo or novelty feature
- Not a bid-spec or enterprise estimating system

Core Value Proposition:
SmartQuoteAI transforms a price from “a number” into a shared understanding.

Trust Model:
Trust is established through transparency, conservative assumptions, and explicit responsibility framing—not intelligence theatrics.

AI Relationship:
AI is a future enhancement layer only.
The core system must remain usable, valuable, and defensible without AI.

Current Status:
ACTIVE — Trust clarity implemented, positioning in progress.

Governance Note:
SmartQuoteAI prioritizes correctness, explainability, and long-term trust over speed or feature breadth.
