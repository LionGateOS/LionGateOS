# SmartQuoteAI — Estimator (Canonical Record)

**Status:** Clarity-Complete v1 (LOCKED)  
**Date Locked:** 2026-01-07  
**Scope:** Trust, clarity, and governance only

---

## 1. What SmartQuoteAI Is

SmartQuoteAI is a **trust-first estimating and pricing-clarity tool**.

Its purpose is to:
- Explain *why* a price exists
- Make scope, assumptions, and risks visible
- Reduce misunderstandings between estimator and client
- Produce defensible, explainable estimates

SmartQuoteAI prioritizes **clarity over automation**.

---

## 2. What SmartQuoteAI Is NOT

SmartQuoteAI is **not**:
- A price calculator
- A pricing template library
- A cost database
- An AI demo
- An automated decision-maker

All pricing remains **user-defined and deterministic**.

---

## 3. EstimatorHome.tsx — Canonical Definition

`EstimatorHome.tsx` is the **primary and authoritative estimating surface**.

As of Clarity-Complete v1, it includes:
- Line-item–based estimating
- Quantity × unit × unit cost math
- Risk and exposure explanation
- Assumptions and sensitivity framing
- Scope inclusion / exclusion clarity
- Responsibility clarification
- Price-change condition explanation
- Client-ready printable summary

This file represents the **first real implementation** of the estimator.

---

## 4. Locked Execution Scope (Completed)

The following execution scope is **complete and locked**:

- Scope transparency (included / optional / not included)
- Price-change visibility
- Responsibility clarity

No further changes are permitted without an explicit unlock.

---

## 5. Intentionally Deferred Areas

The following areas are **intentionally empty by design**:

### Business Profile
- Not yet defined
- No data model or UI exists
- Deferred to a later phase

### Expenses
- Expenses are implicitly represented via line items
- No separate expense module exists yet

### AI Review
- Clearly labeled as “coming soon”
- No AI logic, prompts, or execution present
- AI will summarize and explain only — never decide

These absences are **not bugs**.

---

## 6. Governance Rules Applied

- Backup-first workflow enforced
- Full file replacement only
- Additive-only changes
- Deterministic behavior only
- No AI execution
- No scope expansion beyond approved clarity goals

---

## 7. Why This File Is Locked

The estimator reached a stable point where:
- Core trust objectives are satisfied
- Additional changes risk clarity dilution
- Future work should occur in *other* surfaces

This lock prevents rework, drift, and confusion.

---

## 8. Reopening Criteria

EstimatorHome.tsx may only be reopened if:
- New scope is explicitly approved, **or**
- AI summarization is formally authorized, **or**
- A new estimating paradigm is adopted

Until then, this file remains the canonical baseline.

**End of record.**
