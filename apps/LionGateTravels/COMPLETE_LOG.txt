Status: SUCCESS (Universal Intelligence Engine Active)

PREVIOUS TASKS:
1. High-Intensity Build Loop (GlassCard, Reference Data, Orb Physics): COMPLETED

NEW TASKS (UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE ENGINE):
1. Global Truth Logic:
   - Created 'src/services/GlobalTruthLogic.ts'.
   - Defined 5 Risk Zones: Geopolitical, Infrastructure, Cultural Taboos, Health, Environment.
   - Defined Severity Levels: Low, Medium, High, Critical.
   - Implemented logic to calculate 'pulse patterns' (speed/spread) based on these risks.

2. Global State Monitor (Context):
   - Created 'src/context/GlobalMonitorContext.tsx'.
   - Provides 'activeZone' and 'activeSeverity' to the entire app.

3. Dynamic Warning Cards:
   - Created 'src/components/DynamicWarningCard.tsx'.
   - Cards automatically style themselves based on severity (CSS variables).
   - Cards broadcast their state to the Orb on hover.

4. Living Liquid Orb (Global Monitor Upgrade):
   - Refactored 'LionGateOrb.tsx' to consume the Global Monitor context.
   - Orb now pulsates (changes speed and size/spread) and changes color (Critical = Red) when hovering over risk zones.
   - ADDED: Window resize event listener to ensure Orb physics remain valid if the window shrinks (stress test compliance).

5. Engine Implementation:
   - Updated 'src/App.tsx' to wrap the application in 'GlobalMonitorProvider'.
   - Added a "Universal Intelligence Engine" dashboard to the home view to demonstrate the 5 risk zones and realtime monitor feedback.

Compliance:
- All new files follow Project Lifesaver conventions.
- No legacy code reintroduced.
