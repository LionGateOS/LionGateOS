## The Problem
Most tools give numbers without explanations.

Quotes feel arbitrary.
Budgets feel unreliable.
When someone asks “why?”, the system has no answer.

This is not a data problem.
It is a trust problem.

---

## The Solution
LionGateOS applications are built to show:
- What is known
- What is assumed
- What is uncertain
- Where the information came from

Instead of hiding uncertainty, the system surfaces it.
Instead of replacing judgment, it supports it.
