LionGateOS – App Registry · Baseline 02
======================================

This file formalizes how OS-integrated apps are described.

Apps are:

• Independent projects with their own repositories
• Exported into LionGateOS/apps/<AppName>/
• Referenced here by id, name, category, and integration details

The shell UI should eventually read from this registry instead of hard-coding apps.
